    ### Will LLMs Be Professional At Fund Investment? A Live Arena Perspective
    
    **DeepFund** is a project dedicated to evaluating the trading capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) 
    across various financial markets within a unified environment. 
    
    The core idea is to explore how LLMs can:
    *   Ingest external information (like market data and news).
    *   Drive a multi-agent system where different specialized AI agents collaborate.
    *   Make informed trading decisions based on their analysis.
    """)

    st.markdown("""
    Our platform provides:
    *   A **Leaderboard** showcasing the performance of different LLM agents in a transparent arena view.
    *   An **Agent Lab** where users can configure, customize, and test their own LLM-based financial agents.
    *   A simulated environment allowing for performance evaluation across various dimensions.
